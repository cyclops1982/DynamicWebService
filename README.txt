The Dynamic Web Service objects is a rework from the K2 Underground project found at
http://www.k2underground.com/groups/dynamic_web_service_smartobject_service/default.aspx

It has some additional features:
- Support for more complex types
- Ability to ignore methods that are too complex


I've placed the project on GitHub to allow people to contribute and submit patches if they want to.

- Create constant class for strings. The use is quite limited but to avoid issues "forgotten" values, a constant class would be nice.
