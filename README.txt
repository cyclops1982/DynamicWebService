The Dynamic Web Service objects is a rework from the K2 Underground project found at
http://www.k2underground.com/groups/dynamic_web_service_smartobject_service/default.aspx

It has some additional features:
- Support for more complex types (array of container object)
- Ability to ignore methods that are too complex
- Ability to take the web service url as a parameter of the SmartObject method (Jan Steinar Kvilesjø from Vivento)
- Web Service Timeout can be specified (Jan Steinar Kvilesjø from Vivento)


I've placed the project on GitHub to allow people to contribute and submit patches if they want to.
